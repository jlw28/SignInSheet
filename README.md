# SignInSheet

This project was initially done to better understand the MongoDB library functionalities

Some Improvements That Could Be Done:
 - Generate a class to create columns and rows instead of having it hard coded
 - Allow columns and rows to be added or deleted 
 - Allow editing and delete
 - Add ability to generate sheets into pdf
 - Add ability to email sheets
